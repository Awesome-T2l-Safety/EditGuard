## Introduction

![](./method-cross-v2_00.png)

Inspired by recent developments in diffusion models, we propose a novel image steganography framework named **C**ontrollable, **Ro**bust, and **S**ecure Image **S**teganography (**CRoSS**). This framework offers significant advantages in **controllability** over container images, **robustness** against complex degradation during transmission of container images, and enhanced **security** compared to cover-based image steganography methods. Importantly, these benefits are achieved **without requiring additional training**.
